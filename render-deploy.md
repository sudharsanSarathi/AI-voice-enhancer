   - You'll see real-time logs in the "Logs" tab
   - Build process typically takes 3-5 minutes

2. **Build Steps You'll See:**
   ```
   ==> Cloning from GitHub repository...
   ==> Installing Python dependencies...
   ==> Starting application...
   ==> Your service is live at https://your-app-name.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Wait for "Deploy succeeded" message**

### Step 7: Access Your Live Application

1. **Get Your App URL**
   - Once deployment succeeds, you'll see your app URL
   - Format: `https://voice-enhancer-ai-xxxx.onrender.com`
   - Click the URL to open your live application

2. **Test Your Application**
   - Upload an audio file
   - Adjust the intensity slider
   - Process the audio
   - Download the enhanced result

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "Requirements not found"
**Solution:**
- Check that `requirements.txt` is in your repository root
- Ensure the file is properly committed to GitHub

### Issue 2: Application Won't Start
**Solution:**
- Verify your Start Command is: `python run.py`
- Check that `PORT` environment variable is set to `10000`

### Issue 3: "Module not found" Errors
**Solution:**
- Check your `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- Rebuild by clicking "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

### Issue 4: App Sleeps on Free Tier
**Solution:**
- This is normal for free tier (sleeps after 15 min inactivity)
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Upgrade to Starter plan ($7/month) to prevent sleeping

### Issue 5: Large File Upload Fails
**Solution:**
- Free tier has limited resources
- Consider upgrading to Starter plan for better performance
- Ensure files are under 50MB limit

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your Application

### View Logs:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service name
3. Click "Logs" tab to see real-time application logs

### Check Performance:
1. Click "Metrics" tab to see:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Request count
   - Response times

### Update Your App:
1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically redeploy (if Auto-Deploy is enabled)
3. Or manually deploy by clicking "Manual Deploy"

## ðŸŽ‰ Success! Your App is Live

Once deployed successfully, you can:

- **Share your app**: Send the Render URL to anyone
- **Use it anywhere**: Access from any device with internet
- **Scale up**: Upgrade plans as your usage grows
- **Custom domain**: Add your own domain name (paid plans)

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Keep Free Tier Active**: Visit your app occasionally to prevent extended sleeping
2. **Monitor Usage**: Check Render dashboard for usage statistics
3. **Backup Important**: Keep your GitHub repository as backup
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data to GitHub, use environment variables
5. **Logs are Your Friend**: Always check logs if something isn't working
